# MindMend - AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Remote Health Monitoring

MindMend is an intelligent mental health companion that actively engages in conversations with users to understand their emotional patterns, learn individual traits, and detect cognitive distortions.
It goes beyond surface-level support by teaching users how to shift negative thought patterns through cognitive restructuring, empowering them to develop healthier perspectives. 
Based on each user's history and ongoing interactions, MindMend assigns personalized therapeutic tasks, collects feedback, and securely stores this information to refine future support. 
The platform also offers a suite of interactive tools including journaling, music therapy, mental health games, a guided meditation library, the Beck Depression Inventory test, and a therapist connect feature. 
To ensure users stay on track, MindMend includes progress tracking tools that visualize mental health trends and highlight personal growth over time. By combining evidence-based CBT techniques with continuous feedback and immersive experiences, MindMend bridges the gap between therapy sessions and supports users in achieving consistent, meaningful mental wellness.
